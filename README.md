# Welcome to the Git Challenge

You are now **Git masters**, so now it is time to **test** your skills! In this challenge you will test your **research** and **documentation** skills while also practicing what you have learned

First you will need to define your **team**. Remember, **everyone** has to participate.

Now that you have done it, follow the instructions below:

- Research about the most used **Git Branching strategies** (_Git flow, Github flow, Gitlab flow and Trunk Based Development_)
- Choose **one**, and create a **repository** following the strategy that you chose. You will use this repository to work during this challenge.
- Once you have chosen your strategy, you will have to create a **document** where you will be doing the documentation of the **research** that you have done. Remember to be **creative**. You can use whichever method you prefer to do the document _(Markdown or HTML/CSS are some options)_
  - This document should include some **basic information** about each branching strategy, the reason **why you chose to work** with one of them, the **analysis** of your process _i.e: what difficulties did you find or what could have gone better_.
  - **Bonus**: you can add a menu that allows to move through the document for a better **ease of access**.
- Once you have finished the document, you should share your **repository** with us (_Juan Saenz or Daniel Alvarado_), and during the challenge **presentation** you will need to provide and explain the graph with the **commits** and **branches** following the strategy that you chose.
- If you needed additional commands, add them to the documentation and mention them during the presentation.

Best of luck, **Git masters**. If you have any questions, do not hesitate in contacting us.
